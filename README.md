# Cinch
Bringing the game we wasted many hours playing in college to the web.  

## Rules
 1. There are two teams of two.
 1. Each player is dealt 6 cards, and take turns bidding for trump.
 1. The bids are 1, 2, 3, 4, and cinch.  You can also pass
 1. Cinch is when you get the A, J, low-card(typically 2), and all the points.  Points are: A-4, 10-10, K-3, Q-2, J-1 of any suit, not just trump.
 1. The highest bidder picks trump, and all players discard non-trump cards and are dealt back up to 6 cards. 
 1. The high bidder leads the first trick.  Players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they can play any card.
 1. Once all cards have been played, points are tallied.  If the bidding team made their bid, they get all the points they earned.  If they did not make their bid, they lose the amount of points they bid.  The opposing team always gets the points they earned.
 1. First team to 21 wins.
